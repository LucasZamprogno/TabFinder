# TabFinder

Takes a Spotify playlist or library and searches Ultimate Guitar for tabs, selected the "best" one, and saves the content (if possible).
Still WIP but works on the happy path for bass tabs.

Main TODOs are making an actual nice interface, using a SQL database, and integrating a proper authentication route isntead of inputting a token manually.
