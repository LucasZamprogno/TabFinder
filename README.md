# TabFinder

Takes a Spotify playlist or library and searches Ultimate Guitar for tabs, selected the "best" one, and saves the content (if possible).
Still WIP but works on the happy path for bass tabs.

Main TODOs are making an actual interface, adding a SQL database, and integrating a proper authentication route instead of inputting a token manually.
Later on maybe figuring out some CI/CD infrastructure.

Also part of an ongoing attempt to get more familiar with C# and .NET.
